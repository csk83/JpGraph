# JpGraph (Unoffical)

JpGraph is an Object-Oriented Graph creating library for PHP5 (>=5.1) and PHP7.0 The library is completely written in PHP and ready to be used in any PHP scripts (both CGI/APXS/CLI versions of PHP are supported).


This is the unoffical loader originally forked from ztec for composer from http://jpgraph.net/, I'll try my best to update this repository as soon as updates come out.


## Version 4.2.6
* Fix the issue that 'GetXMinMax' function returns null for xmin in specific case.


This is a port for Composer users to use JpGraph as a Vendor library

use JpGraph\JpGraph::load(); and JpGraph\JpGraph::module('moduleName'); to load required modules
